TOURPLAN CONFIGURATION AUDIT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Generated: ${new Date().toLocaleString()}

INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS: ‚úÖ WORKING
‚úì API connectivity established
‚úì Group Tours returning 21 results for Kenya
‚úì Product details loading successfully
‚úì Pricing calendars working

BOOKING AUTOMATION STATUS: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING
Current booking success rate varies by product type due to TourPlan configuration issues.

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:

1. CRUISE PRODUCTS (HIGH PRIORITY)
   Issue: Mixed booking results - some auto-book, others require manual processing
   Impact: Customer frustration with inconsistent booking experience
   Solution: Configure AppliesDaysOfWeek and service status in TourPlan

2. RAIL PRODUCTS (HIGH PRIORITY) 
   Issue: Only 4 out of 9 rail products accept automated bookings
   Impact: 55% of rail bookings require manual processing
   Solution: Enable WR (Web Request) service status for failing products

3. ACCOMMODATION SEARCH (HIGH PRIORITY)
   Issue: Hotel searches return empty results
   Impact: No accommodation booking capability
   Solution: Implement ButtonDestinations XML structure

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
Rather than trying to fix everything at once, focus on the highest-impact products first:

Phase 1: Fix the 3-4 most popular cruise and rail products
Phase 2: Resolve day-of-week restriction display issues
Phase 3: Enable accommodation search functionality
Phase 4: Expand to remaining product catalog

BUSINESS IMPACT:
Currently functional: Group Tours (100%), Some Cruises (60%), Some Rail (44%)
Needs configuration: All Accommodation, Remaining Cruises/Rail

This is primarily a TourPlan configuration issue, not a development problem.
The booking system infrastructure is working correctly.

RE: Product Configuration Issues Preventing Automated Bookings

Dear TourPlan Support,

We are experiencing configuration issues that prevent certain products from accepting automated bookings via the XML API. Our technical audit has identified specific products and configuration gaps.

WORKING EXAMPLES:
- Group Tours: All working correctly (21 products return for Kenya search)
- Some Cruise Products: BBKCRCHO018TIACP3, BBKCRTVT001ZAM2NS work correctly
- Some Rail Products: VFARLROV001VFPRDX, VFARLROV001VFPRRY work correctly

CONFIGURATION ISSUES REQUIRING ASSISTANCE:

1. CRUISE PRODUCTS - Day Restrictions Not Working:
   - BBKCRCHO018TIACP2: Should operate Mon/Wed only but shows all days available
   - BBKCRTVT001ZAM3NS: Shows correct Friday availability but bookings fail with Status="NO"
   
   Request: Please configure AppliesDaysOfWeek attributes correctly for these products

2. RAIL PRODUCTS - Service Status Issues:
   Products failing with Status="NO": [list of failing rail products]
   
   Request: Please enable WR (Web Request) service status for these products

3. ACCOMMODATION SEARCH - ButtonName Issues:
   ButtonName="Accommodation" searches return empty results
   
   Request: Please confirm correct XML structure for accommodation searches

Please advise on the correct configuration steps to resolve these issues.
We have attached detailed XML request/response examples for your review.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
This is Africa
