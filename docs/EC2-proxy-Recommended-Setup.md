EC2 \+ proxy Recommended Setup

    EC2 Instance: Acts as a proxy to forward requests from your Vercel project to Tourplan's API.  
    Tourplan API: Accepts requests only from your EC2 instance's whitelisted IP.

    Authentication on EC2: Use API keys, OAuth, or custom headers to ensure that only your Vercel project can access the EC2 instance.

    Flow:  
    Vercel sends a request to your EC2 instance with an API key or custom header.  
    Your EC2 instance validates the request (e.g., checks the API key).  
    If valid, the EC2 instance forwards the request to Tourplan's API.  
    Tourplan's API accepts the request because it originates from the whitelisted EC2 IP.

### **What Happens Without Authentication?**

* If you don't use authentication on your EC2 instance, anyone who knows its public IP could send requests to it.  
* Since the EC2 instance is whitelisted by Tourplan, it would forward those requests, potentially exposing the Tourplan API to misuse.

### **1\. Squid Proxy Configuration Issues**

* **Timeouts**: If Squid is not configured to handle long-running or high-volume requests, it may time out or drop connections.  
* **Connection Limits**: Squid has default limits on the number of concurrent connections. If your Vercel project sends many requests in a short time, Squid may reject new connections.  
* **DNS Resolution**: Squid relies on DNS to resolve the Tourplan API's domain. If there are DNS issues, requests may fail intermittently.  
  **How to Fix:**  
* Increase connection limits in the Squid configuration: `bash max_filedesc 65535`  
* Adjust timeouts in the Squid configuration: `bash request_timeout 300 seconds connect_timeout 300 seconds`  
* Ensure Squid is using a reliable DNS resolver (e.g., Google's `8.8.8.8`).

### **2\. AWS EC2 Instance Limits**

* **Network Bandwidth**: If your EC2 instance is on a smaller instance type, it may not have enough network bandwidth to handle the traffic.  
* **CPU/Memory Usage**: Squid can be resource-intensive, especially under heavy load. If the EC2 instance runs out of CPU or memory, Squid may crash or become unresponsive.  
  **How to Fix:**  
* Monitor your EC2 instance's resource usage (CPU, memory, and network) using AWS CloudWatch.  
* Upgrade to a larger instance type if necessary (e.g., from `t2.micro` to `t2.medium`).

### **3\. Tourplan API Rate Limits**

* Tourplan's API may have rate limits that restrict the number of requests you can send within a certain time frame. If you exceed these limits, the API may temporarily block your requests.  
* Squid Proxy does not inherently manage rate limiting, so it may allow your Vercel project to send too many requests too quickly.  
  **How to Fix:**  
* Check Tourplan's API documentation for rate limits.  
* Implement rate limiting in your Vercel project or Squid Proxy to ensure you stay within the allowed limits.

---

### **4\. Firewall or Security Rules**

* If your EC2 instance's security group or network ACLs are misconfigured, it could block outbound or inbound traffic intermittently.  
* Squid Proxy may also be blocked by Tourplan's API if it sends malformed requests or fails to maintain a consistent connection.  
  **How to Fix:**  
* Ensure your EC2 security group allows outbound traffic to Tourplan's API on the required ports (e.g., `443` for HTTPS).  
* Verify that Tourplan has not blocked your EC2 instance's IP due to suspicious activity.

---

### **5\. SNI Hostname Issues**

* Squid Proxy must send the correct SNI (Server Name Indication) hostname when connecting to the Tourplan API. If the SNI hostname is missing or incorrect, the API may reject the connection.  
  **How to Fix:**  
* Ensure Squid is configured to pass the correct SNI hostname: `bash https_port 3128 cert=/path/to/cert.pem key=/path/to/key.pem`  
* Verify that the SNI hostname matches the Tourplan API's domain.

---

### **6\. Caching Problems**

* Squid Proxy may cache responses from the Tourplan API, leading to stale or inconsistent data being returned.  
* If the Tourplan API does not support caching, Squid's caching behavior could cause failures.  
  **How to Fix:**  
* Disable caching in Squid for the Tourplan API: `bash acl no_cache_sites dstdomain .tourplan-api.com cache deny no_cache_sites`  
* Replace `.tourplan-api.com` with the actual domain of the Tourplan API.

---

### **7\. Proxy Authentication**

* If your Squid Proxy requires authentication, ensure that your Vercel project is sending the correct credentials with each request.  
* If authentication fails, Squid may reject the connection.  
  **How to Fix:**  
* Verify that your Vercel project is configured to send the correct proxy credentials: \`\`\`javascript const fetch \= require('node-fetch');  
  const response \= await fetch('https://pa-thisis.nx.tourplan.net/hostconnect/api/hostConnectApi', { method: 'GET', headers: { 'Proxy-Authorization': 'Basic ' \+ Buffer.from('username:password').toString('base64'), }, agent: new HttpsProxyAgent('http://13.210.224.119:3128'), }); \`\`\`

---

### **8\. Logs and Debugging**

* Squid Proxy logs can provide valuable insights into why connections are failing.  
* Check the Squid logs for errors or warnings: `bash tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log tail -f /var/log/squid/cache.log`  
  **Common Errors:**  
* `TCP_MISS`: Indicates a cache miss; the request was forwarded to the origin server.  
* `TCP_DENIED`: Indicates that the request was denied by Squid (e.g., due to ACLs or authentication issues).

### **Summary of Fixes:**

1. Optimize Squid configuration for timeouts, connection limits, and DNS.  
2. Monitor and scale your EC2 instance as needed.  
3. Implement rate limiting to avoid exceeding Tourplan's API limits.  
4. Verify security group and firewall rules.  
5. Ensure the correct SNI hostname is sent.  
6. Disable caching for the Tourplan API.  
7. Check and configure proxy authentication if required.  
8. Analyze Squid logs for detailed error information.
