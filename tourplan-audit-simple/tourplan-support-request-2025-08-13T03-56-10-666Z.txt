RE: Product Configuration Issues Preventing Automated Bookings

Dear TourPlan Support,

We are experiencing configuration issues that prevent certain products from accepting automated bookings via the XML API. Our technical audit has identified specific products and configuration gaps.

WORKING EXAMPLES:
- Group Tours: All working correctly (21 products return for Kenya search)
- Some Cruise Products: BBKCRCHO018TIACP3, BBKCRTVT001ZAM2NS work correctly
- Some Rail Products: VFARLROV001VFPRDX, VFARLROV001VFPRRY work correctly

CONFIGURATION ISSUES REQUIRING ASSISTANCE:

1. CRUISE PRODUCTS - Day Restrictions Not Working:
   - BBKCRCHO018TIACP2: Should operate Mon/Wed only but shows all days available
   - BBKCRTVT001ZAM3NS: Shows correct Friday availability but bookings fail with Status="NO"
   
   Request: Please configure AppliesDaysOfWeek attributes correctly for these products

2. RAIL PRODUCTS - Service Status Issues:
   Products failing with Status="NO": [list of failing rail products]
   
   Request: Please enable WR (Web Request) service status for these products

3. ACCOMMODATION SEARCH - ButtonName Issues:
   ButtonName="Accommodation" searches return empty results
   
   Request: Please confirm correct XML structure for accommodation searches

Please advise on the correct configuration steps to resolve these issues.
We have attached detailed XML request/response examples for your review.

Best regards,
