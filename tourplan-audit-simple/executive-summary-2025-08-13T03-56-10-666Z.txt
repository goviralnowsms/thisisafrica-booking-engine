INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS:  WORKING
✓ API connectivity established
✓ Group Tours returning 21 results for Kenya
✓ Product details loading successfully
✓ Pricing calendars working

BOOKING AUTOMATION STATUS:  PARTIALLY WORKING
Current booking success rate varies by product type due to TourPlan configuration issues.

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:

1. CRUISE PRODUCTS (HIGH PRIORITY)
   Issue: Mixed booking results - some auto-book, others require manual processing
   Impact: Customer frustration with inconsistent booking experience
   Solution: Configure AppliesDaysOfWeek and service status in TourPlan

2. RAIL PRODUCTS (HIGH PRIORITY) 
   Issue: Only 4 out of 9 rail products accept automated bookings
   Impact: 55% of rail bookings require manual processing
   Solution: Enable WR (Web Request) service status for failing products

3. ACCOMMODATION SEARCH (HIGH PRIORITY)
   Issue: Hotel searches return empty results
   Impact: No accommodation booking capability
   Solution: Implement ButtonDestinations XML structure

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
Rather than trying to fix everything at once, focus on the highest-impact products first:

Phase 1: Fix the 3-4 most popular cruise and rail products
Phase 2: Resolve day-of-week restriction display issues
Phase 3: Enable accommodation search functionality
Phase 4: Expand to remaining product catalog

BUSINESS IMPACT:
Currently functional: Group Tours (100%), Some Cruises (60%), Some Rail (44%)
Needs configuration: All Accommodation, Remaining Cruises/Rail

This is primarily a TourPlan configuration issue, not a development problem.
The booking system infrastructure is working correctly.
