# Accommodation API Testing Results & Client Discussion Points

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ SUCCESS: The Portswood Hotel is Working!

**Key Finding:** The Portswood Hotel (`CPTACPOR002PORTST`) IS returning rates, but only for **2026 dates**.

- **2025 dates**: ❌ No rates available (no confirmed rates loaded)
- **2026 January**: ✅ Rates available - AUD $1,540.21 for Standard Room (3 nights)
- **Product Code**: `CPTACPOR002PORTST` - Standard Room only

### Current Issues

1. **Date Range Problem**
   - Rates are only loaded for 2026
   - No rates available for 2025 bookings
   - This explains why searches weren't returning results (we were searching 2025 dates)

2. **Missing Deluxe Room**
   - Only Standard Room product code exists (`CPTACPOR002PORTST`)
   - No Deluxe Room product code found
   - Client mentioned adding Deluxe Room, but it's not appearing in the API

## What's Needed from TourPlan

### Immediate Actions

1. **Load 2025 Rates**
   - Need confirmed rates for current/next year bookings
   - Rates must be marked as "Confirmed" status (not "On Request")
   - Rates must be non-zero

2. **Add Deluxe Room Product**
   - Create new product code for Deluxe Room (e.g., `CPTACPOR002PORTDX`)
   - Or confirm if it was added under a different code
   - Load rates for the new room type

3. **Verify Sabi Sabi Products**
   - Check if rates are loaded for Sabi Sabi room types
   - Confirm product codes are active

## Technical Solution

Once rates are properly configured in TourPlan, the search will work with:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Request SYSTEM "hostConnect_5_05_000.dtd">
<Request>
  <OptionInfoRequest>
    <AgentID>SAMAGT</AgentID>

        <ButtonName>Accommodation</ButtonName>

      </ButtonDestination>

</Request>
```

## Website Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot Hotels (Portswood & Sabi Sabi)
1. Update search to use 2026 dates temporarily for testing
2. Implement direct product code searches for known hotels
3. Create hotel catalog mapping (hotel name → product codes)

### Phase 2: Expand Coverage
1. Document exact TourPlan setup process that works
2. Apply same configuration to other priority hotels
3. Build comprehensive hotel/room mapping

### Phase 3: Full Implementation
1. Dynamic date range detection (which years have rates)
2. Room type filtering
3. Availability calendar

## Questions for Client Meeting

1. **Date Ranges**
   - Which year ranges should have active rates?
   - Is 2025 being loaded soon, or should we work with 2026 for now?

2. **Room Types**
   - Was the Deluxe Room for Portswood created as a new product code?
   - Can you provide the exact product code if it exists?
   - What's the naming convention for room type product codes?

3. **Hotel Priority**
   - Which hotels should we focus on after Portswood and Sabi Sabi?
   - Do all hotels need all room types loaded, or just selected ones?

4. **Rate Configuration**
   - Are rates being set as "Confirmed" status?
   - Are there any zero-rate products that need updating?

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today)
   - Update website to search 2026 dates for testing
   - Show Portswood working with current setup

2. **Short Term** (This Week)
   - Get Deluxe Room product code from client
   - Load 2025 rates in TourPlan
   - Test Sabi Sabi products

3. **Medium Term** (Next Week)
   - Expand to 5-10 priority hotels
   - Build comprehensive room type catalog
   - Implement proper date range handling

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Portswood Standard Room: **WORKING** (for 2026 dates)
- ⏳ Portswood Deluxe Room: Awaiting product code
- ⏳ Sabi Sabi rooms: Need to verify rate loading
- ⏳ 2025 bookings: Need rates loaded in TourPlan

## Contact for TourPlan Support
